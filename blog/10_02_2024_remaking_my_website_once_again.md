# Remaking my website

Turns out making website using a custom javascript framework is a bad idea

# What did i use now?

Im now using [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) with [deno](https://deno.com/).

# What did i change?

All i changed is the [downloads][/downloads] page. The previous download page was not well made.
